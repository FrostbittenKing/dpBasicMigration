This is a basic to Java Translator.
It translates C7420 Videopac+ Basic Code to Java 1.6.
At the moment, only the most important commands are translated

How to use:
 - Build script with several targets
 - ant compile: compiles the parser code
 - ant quickrun: starts the parser and waits for input
   * terminate with ctrl+D in linux, or ctrl+Z in windows(probably)
 - ant run-translate: compiles the the generated javacode
 - ant run-java: compiles and runs the generated javacode
 - ant clean: deletes everything generated
